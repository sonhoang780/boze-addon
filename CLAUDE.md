## MCP & Context Optimization

- **Priority Tooling**: Always prioritize using the `serena` MCP server for context gathering, project indexing, and code search.
- **Token Efficiency**: Before reading multiple files manually with `ls` or `cat`, use `serena`'s search/indexing tools to identify and fetch only the relevant code snippets.
- **Workflow**:
  1. Use `serena` to get a high-level overview of the project structure.
  2. Use `serena` to locate specific logic or variable definitions instead of broad file reads.
  3. Only request full file content if summaries are insufficient.
